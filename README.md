# CountingFociInsideNuclei

This script can be used to count and measure foci inside nuclei. The first 30 lines of the script contain global parameters that users should check and set as required before using.


For each image processed, the script will create 1 CSV table with data about the nulei, one CSV table with data about the foci, and one zip file containing the ROIs found by the program.
